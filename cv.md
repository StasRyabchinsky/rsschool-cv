## Briefly About Myself:

I am 22 years old. I started my career more than 3 years ago and now I will represent the interests of Philips in the lighting industry,
consumer lighting in Minsk.
In general terms, I have a flexible work schedule, which allows me to learn more new knowledge.

I have creativity. I have been drawing since childhood, and although I was not sent to art sections and I was not fond of it professionally,
over the years my level of drawing has become much better. about six months ago, I switched to digital painting in the Ptocreate program, where I can learn new skills and share my results with an unlimited number of users
I think this was an important mention, because I really love to see the result of my work with my eyes and this has become one of the most important criteria for choosing web development
